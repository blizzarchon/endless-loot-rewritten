# Endless Loot Rewritten
My attempt at rewriting the tool that generates the "Endless Loot" addon content for the mod, Captain's Edition, a mod for FTL: Faster Than Light.

The aim of this tool is not only to create something to mimic the Endless Loot tool (and maybe tweak it for the better), but also to establish a framework to generate variations for any mod, not just Captain's Edition. :)
